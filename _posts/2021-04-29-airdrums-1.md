## AirDrums - Part 1 :drum:

Haven't we all once dreamed about being a rock star? Shredding our air guitars, screaming into the imaginary microphone
or drumming wildly into the air..
At least I have, so I set out on a mission to turn one of these into actual sound.

With the availability of a powerful pretrained model for human action recognition from
[TwentyBN](https://20bn.com/licensing/sdk/evaluation) and a tool for quickly training your own application layer on top,
the hypothesis is that it should only take a few example videos to turn my webcam into a real-time air drum kit.


### Data Collection
In order to design the data collection and represent a useful repertoire of drums for our first gig, we need to take a
quick look at the basic drum kit setup, consisting of five drums and three cymbals:

We're going to collect videos for hitting each of these 8 pieces.
As we're planning to use a simple webcam setup which only shows the top half of the body, we'll have to
simulate the bass drum kick with something else, so I chose a thump with the fist on the chest.

In the `SenseStudio` tool, we can setup these 8 classes and start recording videos for each of them.

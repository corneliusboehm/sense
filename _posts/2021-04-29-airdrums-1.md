## AirDrums - Part 1


### Motivation
Haven't we all once dreamed about being a rock star? Shredding our air guitars, screaming into the imaginary microphone or drumming wildly into the air.. At least I have, so I set out on a mission to turn at least one of these into actual sound.

With the availability of a powerful pretrained model for human action recognition from [TwentyBN](https://20bn.com/licensing/sdk/evaluation) and a tool for quickly training your own application layer on top, the hypothesis is that it should only take a few example videos to turn my webcam into a real-time drum kit.


### Drum kit 101
In order to design the data collection and represent a useful repertoire of drums for our first gig, we need to do a quick intro to the basic drum kit setup.
